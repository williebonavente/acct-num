# Basic Banking System Flowcharting - Structure Flowchart

## Given: A file of transactions `INFILE`

### Input Record

#### `INFILE`

|`ACCNO`|`ACCNAME`|`TRANSCODE`|`AMOUNT`|
|-----|---|---|---|
|`X(3)`|`X(24)`|`(TC)X`|`9(5)V99`|
|`001`| MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE | `D`| $3000000$|
|`001`| MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE | `W`| $0500000$|
|`001`| MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE | `D`| $2000000$|
|`002`| RAINAH CASSANDRA NAYRE | `D`| $50000000$|
|`002`| RAINAH CASSANDRA NAYRE | `W`| $1000000$|
|`003`| MARLON JAMES NAYRE | `D`| $3000000$|

## Requirements: `OUTFILE`

**WRITE** `ACCNO`, `ACCNAME`, and `BALANCE`. At end of File, **WRITE** the total depositors and the total accumulated balances.

*Note:* Records are arranged according to `ACCNO`.

## `OUTFILE`: Output Layout

```
                        MJRC SAVING BANK
                    Maypajo, Caloocan Branch
                        DEPOSITORâ€™S REPORT

    ACCOUNT			     ACCOUNT			     BALANCE
     NUMBER				  NAME				     AMOUNT

      001			MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE      	45,000.00
      002			RAINAH CASSANDRA NAYRE		40,000.00
      003			MARLON JAMES NAYRE			30,000.00

TOTAL DEPOSITORS: 3 
TOTAL ACCUMULATED BALANCES: 115,000.00 

TOTAL ACCUMULATED BALANCES: 115,000.00 
```

### Variable Documentation Proper

*Note*: `X` stands for the number of characters allocated in the record. The `9(5)v99` means this variable is Numeric type of length $8$ and $2$ digits after decimal. For example: $30,000.00$ it is int the *COBOL* legacy system.

#### INPUTS

> `INFILE` - stands for **INPUT FILE**, given.

*Note*: File content have always interrelated records, and record (row) have always interrelated data.

> `REC-IN` - stands for **RECORD INPUT**

*Note*: Inside of record we have the following variables that we must declare, because we need to initialize for inputs.

> `ACCNO-IN` - stands for **ACCOUNT NUMBER INPUT**,
for example (`001`, `002`, `003`).

> `ACCNAME-IN` - stands for **ACCOUNT NAME INPUT**, for example (MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE, MARLON JAMES NAYRE, MARLON JAMES NAYRE).

> `TC` - stands for **TRANSCODE**, there are two only the `D` for **Deposit** and `W` for **Withdrawal**.

>`D` - stands for **Deposit**, add to current balance.

>`W` - stands for **Withdraw**, subtract to current balance.

> `AMOUNT` - the current input balance before the transaction takes place. It was given in the `INPUT FILE`.

### OUTPUTS

> `OUTFILE` - it is the expected output file after the process was finished.

> `OUTREC` - output of the record per each row, for example `(001				MARK JEZEKIAH NAYRE      		45,000.00)`

> `REC-OUT`

> `ACCNO-OUT` - The **ACCOUNT NUMBER OUTPUT**

> `ACCNAME-OUT` - The **ACCOUNT NAME OUTPUT**

> `BAL-OUT` - Balance output for each record after the transaction of the person was finished.

#### *Temporary, Accumulator, and with constant value of string variables*

> `BAL`

> `EOFSW`

> `TACCNO`

> `TACCNAME`

> `TOTDREC`

> `DCTR`

> `DCTR-OUT`

> `DCTR`

> `TOTBREC `

> `BCTR`

> `BCTR-OUT`
